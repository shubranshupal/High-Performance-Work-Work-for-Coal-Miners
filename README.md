# High-Performance-Work-Work-for-Coal-Miners
It is a work-wear designed for coal miners to know about the hazardous gases present in the mine, also the temperature down there.
The gases like methane, carbon monoxide are present in abundance in the mines, which can cause permanent damage to human body.
So to prevent that, this work-wear is designed to let the owner know what are the conditions down in the mine and to save the workers if the presence of gases are increased than the safe limits.
The Components include: MQ-2, MQ-135, DHT-11, Arduino nano.
